                    <p>This is Cris being the major dog lover that she is. This is her and her husband Tony the day they adopted two more dogs. They adopted them from Little Hills of Kentucky Animal Rescue. Both of the new family members originated from a kill shelter. Now they have THREE "children"!!!! Maria, Obo and Buddy... Everyone is so happy!!!!</p>

                    <p>I&apos;m relatively sure Cristene and I met in 1994. I remember meeting her very well. We were in the Hamilton Meijer. She had her Meijer uniform on with her hair pulled up into a ponytail to keep it out of her face and seemed so young. She was young. At that time, she was 20 and I was 29. We became instant friends. I was fixing one of her deli scales and showing her how to resolve the issue without me and we were cracking up. I really can&apos;t remember what we were laughing about, I just remember her contagious laugh and how infectious it was. Soon after that we were often out together, having a couple of drinks, dancing, and listening to 80&apos;s music. It didn&apos;t take long before I realized that Cris had a very deep level of love and respect for all animals and cherished her dogs as family. I remember when she moved out of her parents&apos; house and into her own, she had a chocolate lab named Chewy.

                    <p>Cristene Napier and Anthony Giordano met in March of 2008. They were together for a little more than three years before they got married. They had a very beautiful wedding and an incredible reception on a riverboat as it navigated down the Ohio River. It really was like a storybook. I remember being so very happy for her that night. If anyone deserves happiness, she surely does.</p>

                    <p>You would have a hard time making Cristene choose between her parents and her dogs, her love for both is a special part of her being. She has always shared a wonderful relationship full of mutual love and respect with her parents. A very special family, one that we could all probably learn something from.</p>

                    <p>Cristene&apos;s love for canines has been apparent from day one. When I first met her, she was living with her parents and at that time they had four dogs. Once she moved out on her own, she got Chewy, his name definitely fit him well... Not long after that she saved a dog at work that was hurt... She named her Lady.  Later she found out Lady was part Rottweiler.

                    <p>Cris is definitely a worshipper of the sun. She loves the beach and frequently chooses to spend her vacations on some exotic stretch of sand. The beaches she has visited include Ubatuba, Brazil; St. Thomas; St. Croix; Mykonos Island, Greece; Punta Cana, Dominican Republic; and of course several in Florida. Rough Life... </p>

                    <p>I realized while writing this, that after 26 years I had never met Cris&apos;s sister Teresa. I had to ask her sister&apos;s name and age for this website. Teresa is 8 years older than Cris, recently went back to college and is now an RN. When I told Cris that I had never met her sister she said, &quot;I had a boyfriend once who said &apos;she is like you, only stereo&apos;.&quot; I found that to be hilarious because they look so much alike....</p>

                    <p>Cristene and I have been through a lot in the 26 years we have known each other. I have to say she has always &horbar; ALWAYS, been there for me. Whether that meant taking me to a doctor&apos;s appointment when I did not want to go, working a puzzle and drinking wine, or helping me through some of the hardest moments of my life. I hope she knows how much I truly appreciate it and that I will be there for her, come hell or high water...

                    <p>Cris is like the rest of us when it comes to work and would rather not do it. She is currently doing some type of accounting thing at a commercial flooring place close to her home. She is definitely not at all crazy about it but by the looks of the photo they at least have a good time.</p>
